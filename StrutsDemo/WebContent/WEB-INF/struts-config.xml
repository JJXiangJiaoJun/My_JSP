<!--
     This is the Struts configuration file for the example application,
     using the proposed new syntax.

     NOTE:  You would only flesh out the details in the "form-bean"
     declarations if you had a generator tool that used them to create
     the corresponding Java classes for you.  Otherwise, you would
     need only the "form-bean" element itself, with the corresponding
     "name" and "type" attributes.
-->

<!--
首先配置formbean表单对象 
-->
<struts-config>
	<form-beans>
		<form-bean name="helloForm" type="Form.HelloForm"></form-bean>
	</form-beans>
	
	<action-mappings>
	
		<action path="/test" forward="/login.jsp"></action>	
												<!--访问test.do 可以直接方位login.jsp-->
		<action attribute="helloForm"
				input="/StrutsDemo/login.jsp"
				name="helloForm"			
				path="/hello"  				
				scope="request"
				type="Action.HelloAction">
				
		<forward name="success"  path="/mypage.jsp"/>		
		</action>	
	</action-mappings>
</struts-config>
